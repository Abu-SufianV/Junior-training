## W1S1
Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. 
Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with  places after the decimal.

## W1S2
Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing 
exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single 
line of two space-separated long integers.

## W1S3
Given a time in 12-hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.

Note: 
- 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock is 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
- 12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock is 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.

## W1S4
There is a collection of input strings and a collection of query strings. For each query string, 
determine how many times it occurs in the list of input strings. Return an array of the results.

## W1S5
Given an array of integers, where all elements but one occur twice, find the unique element.

## W2S1
There is a large pile of socks that must be paired by color. Given an array of integers representing
the color of each sock, determine how many pairs of socks with matching colors there are.
